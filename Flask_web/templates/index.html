<h1>Flask app</h1>
<h2>Welcome to Flaskâ€™s documentation. Get started with Installation and then get an overview with the Quickstart. There is also a more detailed Tutorial that shows how to create a small but complete application with Flask. Common patterns are described in the Patterns for Flask section. The rest of the docs describe each component of Flask in detail, with a full reference in the API section.

Flask depends on the Jinja template engine and the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit. The documentation for these libraries can be found at</h2>
